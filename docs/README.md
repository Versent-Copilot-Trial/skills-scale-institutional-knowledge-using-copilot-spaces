# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This README serves as the central entry point for understanding how we run projects, collaborate across teams, and deliver value to our customers.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible project management approach built around five core lifecycle stages: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release & Deployment**, and **Retrospective**. Our methodology is grounded in customer-first thinking, iterative delivery of small increments, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. We believe in continuous improvement, delivering testable increments frequently, and learning from every iteration to refine our processes and outcomes.

Successful project delivery at OctoAcme depends on well-defined roles and responsibilities across the team. **Project Managers** coordinate schedules, manage risks and dependencies, facilitate key ceremonies, and maintain clear communication channels. **Product Managers** own the product vision, prioritize the backlog based on customer and business value, and measure outcomes against success metrics. **Developers** implement features with quality and testability in mind, write comprehensive tests, and conduct thorough code reviews. **QA/Testing** professionals validate quality standards and ensure acceptance criteria are met before releases. **Stakeholders** provide critical inputs, approvals, and strategic direction. This cross-functional structure ensures both strategic alignment and tactical execution remain in sync throughout the project lifecycle.

Communication and risk management are fundamental to our delivery excellence. The team engages in daily 15-minute standups to share progress and identify blockers, weekly delivery syncs to review status and flag risks, and end-of-sprint demos to showcase completed work. We use standardized status update templates to maintain consistency and clarity. Our **Risk Register** provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks with formal escalation paths that flow from team-level discussions to the PM, then to the Product Lead or sponsor as needed. This structured communication framework ensures shared understanding across all stakeholders and enables rapid response to emerging challenges.

Quality assurance and delivery practices at OctoAcme emphasize automation, transparency, and continuous feedback. Our **Pull Request workflow** requires small PRs (ideally ≤400 lines), linked issues, automated CI checks, and code review before merging. Our comprehensive **testing strategy** includes unit tests for new logic, integration tests for component interactions, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI pipelines. We use **GitHub Projects** boards to track work through defined stages (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and monitor key metrics including velocity, burndown charts, and success indicators defined in project charters. **Release management** follows standardized practices with pre-release requirements, staged deployments, and documented rollback plans to minimize risk and ensure reliable delivery.
