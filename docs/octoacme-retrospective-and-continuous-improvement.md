# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Facilitated by Scrum Master
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure all relevant roles are represented (Developers, Product Manager, Project Manager, Scrum Master, Business Analyst, UX Designer, QA/Testing, Release Manager as applicable to the sprint/release)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines (Scrum Master tracks)
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync (Project Manager and Scrum Master)
- Process improvements involving specific roles assigned to appropriate owner (e.g., BA for requirements process, Release Manager for deployment process)
